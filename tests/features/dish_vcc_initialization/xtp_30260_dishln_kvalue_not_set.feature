	Scenario: TMC Validates and Reports K-Value not set in Dish Leaf Nodes
		Given a TMC with already loaded Dish-VCC map version
		When the Dish Leaf Node is restarted
		And the Dish Leaf Node finds k-value not set on either of Dish Leaf Node or Dish Manager
		Then Dish Leaf Node reports k-value not set on either of Dish Leaf Node or Dish Manager
		And the Central Node reports the same and prohibits any further command execution
