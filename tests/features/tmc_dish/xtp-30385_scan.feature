Scenario: TMC executes Scan command on DISH.LMC
    Given a Telescope consisting of TMC, DISH <dish_ids>, simulated CSP and simulated SDP
    And the Telescope is in ON state
    And TMC subarray <subarray_id> is in READY ObsState 
    And DishMaster <dish_ids> is in dishMode OPERATE with pointingState TRACK
    When I issue the scan command to the TMC subarray <subarray_id>
    Then the DishMaster <dish_ids> remains in dishMode OPERATE and pointingState TRACK  
    And  TMC SubarrayNode transitions to obsState SCANNING
    And TMC SubarrayNode transitions to obsState READY once the scan duration is elapsed
    Examples:

        | subarray_id | dish_ids                       |
        | 1           | SKA001,SKA036,SKA063,SKA100    |
