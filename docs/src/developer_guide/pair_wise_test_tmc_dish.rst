****************************

Pair wise testing is way of testing the TMC code with real DISH subsystem in place. 
using latest `test-harness` implemented.

To test with tmc_sdp pair execute the command `make k8s-test MARK=tmc_sdp SDP_SIMULATION_ENABLED=false`.

* ``On``               -  Testing On command on TMC with real DISH Masters and mocked/simulated SDP and CSP subsystems.
    
* ``Off``              -  Testing Off command on TMC with real DISH Masters and mocked/simulated SDP and CSP subsystems.
    
* ``Configure``        -  Testing Configure command on TMC with real DISH Masters and mocked/simulated SDP and CSP subsystems.

* ``End``              -  Testing End command on TMC with real DISH Masters and mocked/simulated SDP and CSP subsystems.

* ``Abort``            -  Testing Abort command on TMC with real DISH Masters and mocked/simulated SDP and CSP subsystems.

* ``Scan``            -  Testing Scan command on TMC with real DISH Masters and mocked/simulated SDP and CSP subsystems.
